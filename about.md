My name is Chris Nicholls and I am a Quantitative Developer at Quadrature Capital. I previously completed my PhD at the University of Oxford
in number theory. This blog is my attempt to document my thoughts about machine learning. You can find my old maths page [here](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nichollsc/).
