My name is Chris Nicholls and I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford
studying number theory. In my spare time I enjoy learning about other things,
and this is my attempt to document my thoughts about machine learning. You can
find my maths page [here](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nichollsc/).
